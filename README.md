# sacrifice-map

Unfinished experiment with data provided by this contest: https://github.com/uselesspress/decapitated-animals-data

Uses d3 to map out the locations of each decapitated animal found in NYC. My plans included dynamically generating lines connecting each location to see if it revealed a "pattern". Another idea was to generate a chloropleth map, separated by school district, measuring the frequency of appearances in that district.
